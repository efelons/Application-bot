## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/better-application-bot.git
cd better-application-bot
```

### 2. Install dependencies

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure your environment

```
BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
PREFIX=!
OWNER_ID=your_discord_user_id
```

⚠️ **Never share your `.env` file** — it contains your bot token.

### 4. Run the bot
